/*
 *  THE RUST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
 *  CHAPTER 3   ::  COMMON PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  
 *  Introduction
 *  ------------
 *  This chapter introduces concepts that appear in almost every programming
 *  language but in the context of Rust. We will learn about:
 *
 *      * Variables
 *      * Basic Types
 *      * Functions
 *      * Comments
 *      * Control Flow
 *
 *  Keywords
 *  --------
 *  Rust has a set of keywords that have been reserved for use by the language
 *  only. These names cannot be used as names of variables or functions.
 *  List of reserverd words:
 *
 *  as          Primitive casting, disambiguating the specific trait containing
 *              an item, or renaming items in "use" and "extern crate" state-
 *              ments.
 *  break       Exit a loop immediately.
 *  const       Constant items and constant raw pointers.
 *  continue    Continue to the next loop iteration.
 *  crate       External crate linkage or a macro variable representing the
 *              crate in which the macro is defined.
 *  else        Fallback for "if" and "if let" control flow statements.
 *  enum        Defining an enumeration.
 *  extern      External crate, function, and variable linkage.
 *  false       Boolean false literal.
 *  fn          Function definition and function pointer type.
 *  for         Iterator loop, part of trait impl syntax, and higher-ranked
 *              lifetime syntax.
 *  if          Conditional branching.
 *  impl        Inherent and trait implementation block.
 *  in          Part of "for" loop syntax.
 *  let         Variable binding.
 *  loop        Unconditional, infinite loop.
 *  match       Pattern matching.
 *  mod         Module declaration.
 *  move        Makes a closure take ownership of all its captures.
 *  mut         Denotes mutability in references, raw pointers, and pattern
 *              bindings.
 *  pub         Denotes public visibility in struct fields, "impl" blocks, and
 *              modules.
 *  ref         By-reference binding.
 *  return      Return from function.
 *  Self        Type alias for the type implementing a trait.
 *  self        Method subject or current module.
 *  static      Global variable or lifetime lasting the entire program execution.
 *  struct      Structure definition.
 *  super       Parent module of the current module.
 *  trait       Trait definition.
 *  true        Boolean true literal.
 *  type        Type alias and associated type definitions.
 *  unsafe      Denotes unsafe code, functions, traits, and implementations.
 *  use         Import symbols into scope.
 *  where       Type constraint clauses.
 *  while       Conditional loop.
 *
 *  In addition there're some reserverd keywords for future use:
 *  abstract
 *  alignof
 *  become
 *  box
 *  do
 *  final
 *  macro
 *  offsetof
 *  override
 *  priv
 *  proc
 *  pure
 *  sizeof
 *  typeof
 *  unsized
 *  virtual
 *  yield
 *
